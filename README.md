# OneTouch - toggle between touchscreen laptops with One Touch
> Tested on Yoga Slim 2in1

### Some Background
In the excitement of purchasing a new touchscreen laptop, I decided to make this tool in order to toggle between touchscreen and non-touchscreen mode.

### Installation and Setup:
1. Download the `OneTouch.exe` file and run it as **administrator**. It should automatically place itself in the tray inside the taskbar. Click [here](https://github.com/SuzanTurner/OneTouch/blob/main/OneTouch.exe) if your download hasn't started.
2. Make sure to add this to Startup.
3. Click on the icon to toggle between ts modes.
4. **Use`<crtl> + <alt> + t`** as a shortcut key.
